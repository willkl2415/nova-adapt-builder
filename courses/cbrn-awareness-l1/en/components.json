These four categories represent the principal non-conventional threat types that military personnel may encounter in operational environments.</p><p><strong>Chemical</strong> threats involve toxic substances designed to cause harm through their chemical properties. Examples include nerve agents, blister agents, and choking agents.</p><p><strong>Biological</strong> threats involve the deliberate use of bacteria, viruses, or toxins to cause disease or harm. These may be delivered through aerosol, water contamination, or direct contact.</p><p><strong>Radiological</strong> threats involve the dispersal of radioactive material, commonly through a radiological dispersal device (dirty bomb). The primary risk is contamination rather than a nuclear explosion.</p><p><strong>Nuclear</strong> threats involve nuclear detonation, producing blast, thermal radiation, and nuclear fallout. This represents the most destructive category of CBRN threat.</p>",

Protection requires IPE including the respirator and protective suit.</p><p><strong>Biological agents</strong> have an incubation period, meaning effects may not be apparent for days or weeks after exposure. Detection is extremely difficult in the field. Medical countermeasures including vaccination and antibiotics are the primary defence.</p><p><strong>Radiological hazards</strong> are detectable using radiation survey instruments such as Personal Dosimeters and RADIAC equipment. Contamination can persist in the environment for extended periods. Protection involves distance, shielding, and limiting time of exposure.</p><p><strong>Nuclear detonation</strong> produces immediate and catastrophic effects including blast overpressure, thermal radiation, and electromagnetic pulse (EMP).
